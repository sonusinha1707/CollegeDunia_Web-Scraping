- Parses the page content with **BeautifulSoup** to extract college details like:
  - College name
  - Location
  - Rating
  - Course fee
  - Placement data (if available)
- Supports deep page crawling with intelligent wait strategies.
- Can be extended to multiple course categories or other Collegedunia pages.
